
We wanted to create an app that would auto generate a recipe and a movie for the busy worker of today to use to decide their evening.

With an auto generated Movie/Show, it narrows down what to watch in a field with millions of hours of entertainment.

With the spoonful app, we could also randomize a recipe for them to enjoy with their movie, whether its dinner, a snack, or a dessert!

Bootstrap was utilized in this website to autoload styling. 


There are three user inputs on the site. 

1) "Eat & Watch": Randomly generates both fields to confirm a show and food for the user

2) "Movie": If they just want a movie, they can click this to randomize the selections for something to watch

3) "Dinner": If they want something other than an appetizer, dessert, or dinner they can continue to click through and generate new options
